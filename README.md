## 🎮 Game Features

- **3D Racing**: Immersive 3D go-kart racing with realistic physics
- **AI Opponents**: Two computer-controlled racers with different driving styles:
  - **Aggressive AI** (Orange): Fast and takes risks
  - **Cautious AI** (Blue): Steady and safe driving
- **Combat Racing**: Ram opponents to damage them and send them back to start
- **Hit Point System**: Each cart has 10 HP, lose all HP and reset to start position
- **Dynamic Track**: Elliptical track with hills, slopes, and elevation changes
- **Realistic Physics**: Acceleration, deceleration, momentum, and speed-dependent steering
- **Wall Penalties**: Hit walls and get reset to track center with 3-second timeout
- **Health Indicators**: Visual health bars above each cart
- **Dual Camera Modes**: 
  - **Driver View**: Third-person camera that follows the player cart
  - **Overview Mode**: Bird's-eye view with mouse controls to rotate, zoom, and pan around the entire track

## 🎯 Controls

### Driving Controls
- **↑ Arrow Up**: Accelerate forward
- **↓ Arrow Down**: Reverse/brake
- **← Arrow Left**: Turn left
- **→ Arrow Right**: Turn right

### Camera Controls
- **🗺️ Overview Button**: Toggle between driver view and overview mode
- **Mouse in Overview Mode**:
  - **Left-click + drag**: Rotate view around track
  - **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
  - **Right-click + drag**: Pan view

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei** - Useful helpers for R3F
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD for automatic deployment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hellcart-race.git
cd hellcart-race

```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The game uses a component-based architecture with:

- **GoCart Component**: Individual cart logic with physics and AI
- **Track Component**: Procedural track generation with elevation mapping
- **Collision System**: Wall detection and cart-to-cart collision handling
- **Physics Engine**: Custom physics with acceleration, momentum, and realistic steering
- **AI System**: Waypoint navigation with different driving personalities

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Combat System
- Carts can ram each other to deal damage
- Hit cart takes 1 damage and is stunned for 100ms
- Carts with 0 HP reset to their starting position

### Physics System
- Realistic acceleration and deceleration
- Speed-dependent steering responsiveness
- Momentum conservation and friction simulation
- Track elevation following with automatic cart alignment

### Penalty System
- Wall collisions: 3-second timeout at track center
- Cart collisions: 100ms stun for the victim
- HP depletion: Full reset to starting position

## 🤝 Contributing

**Pull requests are welcome, but only if the code is written by an AI!** 

This project is an experiment in AI-assisted development. All code contributions should be generated by AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) rather than hand-written by humans. 

When submitting a PR:
- Specify which AI assistant was used
- Include the prompts or conversation that led to the code changes
- Ensure the AI-generated code follows the existing patterns and architecture

This helps us explore the capabilities and limitations of AI in software development while building something fun!
